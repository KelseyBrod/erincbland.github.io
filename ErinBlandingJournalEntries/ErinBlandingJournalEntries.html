        Nothing much going on. Woke up at 7 AM accidentally. Hopefully
        Staci and Antwaine will want help moving in, so I have something
        to do and can hang! Yesterday, worked, which is getting kinda 
        boring in all honesty.

        Found a bug in the hotel room. Tried out NaanStop for the first time 
        and I liked it! :) Met some nice old bald guy in there. 
        Went to therapy with my new therapist and I like her a lot - she's much more validating.

        Met with housing the day before and didn't resolve anything really
        I don't believe. I move in the day after tomorrow which is very
        exciting. I've been sleeping pretty well too - I fuck with that 
        melatonin I got really fucking heavy. Andrew is gone so I miss 
        him a lot obviously. I miss Raf a lot too. I seriously can't wait 
        for us to all be in the same place again for a whole YEAR! Did
        a lot of to dos yesterday and maybe found a psychiatrist which
        is exciting! :)

        My name is Erin Blanding and I am a junior at Duke from Wilmington, North Carolina. I feel like such a computer science baddie 
        using VSC. I dropped my CS 201 class because I hated it but I like this! I have a pet bunny 
        named Honeybun.
