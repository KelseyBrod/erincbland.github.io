    Welcome to Cheerio!, a fun new social media music sign. The main focus of the site
    should be the social aspect of listening to music. This grid is supposed to 
    represent your friends that have different icons and you can see what they're listening to in real time.
    It would also
    be cool if the icons had a "sleep mode" or something similar so you can see when your friends are active
    versus when they aren't. Ideally, you'd also be able to comment on what they're listening to.

<div>
    <h1>Your current song</h1>
</div>
<img src="Images/Judas.jpg" alt="Album cover for Judas by Lady Gaga" class="image3">
<audio class="player2" controls src=""></audio>

<p>
    This part of the site would showcase what you're listening to/your current song - would be cool if lyrics 
    could pop up in real time. I was going to add the actual mp3 of this song but I didn't want to pay for it or
    get a virus. This is a brand new computer! Something else that would be cool is a recommended feature. I read
    a bit about spotify's algorithm for suggesting music and it seems like most of it is based off of your
    listening habits, which makes sense. I personally think spotify's algorithm is okay - it seems to me like
    they prioritize the variety of music you listen to/exposing you to new music over showing you songs that
    you'll definetly like.
